# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

The objective of this assignment is to create a Weather Dashboard that shows the current day forecast as well as the 5 day forecast for a city that is entered by the end user. The HTML, CSS, and Javascript was created by myself in order to meet the acceptance criteria below.

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
